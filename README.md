## What? 

I built this for a Savant IP Audio 125. It is from a family of powered amps and media streamer.

e.g. PAV-SIPA125SM]
5x Inputs:
2 Optical Inputs: one often used for doorbell/PA
2 RCA Inputs 
1 Internal Media Streamer (input 5)

6x Outputs:
4 powered zones
Analogue out
Digital out

I welcome testers with other Savant IP Audio systems. The code may fail with a different number of inputs/outpots. 

Savant Audio Switches are a different beast, see https://github.com/akropp/savantaudio-homeassistant


## Methods

The Savant IP Audio server has an http interface to monitor and adjust settings. This component pulls information every 30 seconds by default.  

Please note that Savant hosts generally assume they are they master of the universe, so changes you make through this interface likely will not be noticed in your Savant host and app. This integration is useful if you want to use your Savant IP Audio in a standalone fashion.

I tried to get access to the live metadata from the media  (it's Shairport) but I couldn't get this without disrupting the flow to the Savant app.
